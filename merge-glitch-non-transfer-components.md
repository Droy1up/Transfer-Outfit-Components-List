Merging components is done in a Rockstar Versus Job called Crooked Cop when you add a merge component onto an outfit. Merge components are typically items that appear as invisible or that do not have opposite components on the male/female character. This is typically done when transferring merge components from one character slot to the other but there are ways to do this with other popular glitches like DMO, Magic Slot outfits, or with non-transfer components.

The method to merge the t-shirt layer or ‚ÄúTorso 1‚Äù [without doing a component transfer glitch](https://youtu.be/NNS64UNdzo8) is available on my Youtube channel with a text tutorial in the description.

Examples of Torso 1 items that can be added to certain tops and removed for merging are below as well as ideas for what you can merge. Please note, only Torso 1 can currently be merged with this method until the community finds other things üôÇ
