Merging components is done in a Rockstar Job ([current jobs](https://youtu.be/AO7_rs0uc_Q)) when you add a merge component onto an outfit. Merge components are typically items that appear as invisible or that do not have opposite components on the male/female character. This is typically done when transferring merge components from one character slot to the other but there are ways to do this with other popular glitches like DMO, Magic Slot outfits, or with [non-transfer components](https://xtiffi.com/ufaqs/merge-glitch-non-transfer-components/). <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">The components in green will also work for Save Wizard/Ped merging.</span>

_[Looking for all components? Check out my Youtube Channel.](https://youtube.com/xtiffi)_

There is a condensed list of the most commonly used merge components with info on each layer below but there are hundreds of items that merge on both characters. My goal is to always only share/highlight older clothing items if possible, as often new dlcs will fill in some of the ‘gaps’ in the prior dlcs opposite component, thus not allowing them to merge anymore.

Large Back Crew Emblems can be merged using the patched denim biker jackets or cuts on male & female that don’t have components. You can then merge any top that acts as a jacket onto that crew emblem. Logos react differently and the same crew emblem on 2 tops can turn into something totally different depending on the top so this is a toss up. Varies greatly.</td>

_**Merging is fairly confusing if you are not familiar with how it works. Important things to note are:**_  
1\. You need at least 2 slots to merge components. The slots can be saved outfits or your “Current Outfit” or the outfit you wear into job and Slot 1 Or Slot 20.  
2\. You can merge from the slot BEFORE or AFTER the save outfit that has merge components on it. Ex: Merge “Slot 2” (component you want) into “Slot 1” (merge component outfit).  
3\. Purchase a rebreather or earpiece at Ammunation prior to going into job. The rebreather will work to bring most outfits out of job but if you have on a hat that you want to save, use an earpiece instead. Scroll right for rebreather and left for earpiece.  
4\. Access transferred but non-clickable outfits/merge outfits in job set to Player Owned Clothing, add a rebreather/earpiece, quit through phone, and immediately start Mission A Titan of A Job to make changes in Ammunation  
5\. If you are wearing blacklisted or invisible components not compatible in freemode, you may not be able to wear them online even after opening or making changes to the outfit in Ammunation  
6\. You cannot merge an item onto something else that does not have a component or a component that you are not able to purchase separately. Ex: On male, white tron shoes and white joggers do not have a component, therefore, you cannot merge these two items together. On female, pink heart stockings do not have a component and the pink stuntman canvas shoes component (silver stuntman canvas shoes) is attached to bottoms that you cannot change. Because of this, you cannot merge these 2 items together due to not being able to add a merge bottom onto the silver stuntman canvas shoes.
